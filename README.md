CPSC 210 Software Construction Personal Project

P1:
have at least 1 package (probably named "ui")
have at least one class, with a main method, and two other methods,
 called by that main method. It is okay for these methods to be declared static
have print statements in each of the methods so that when you run the program,
 messages are printed out, displaying the execution.

 P2:
 Get basic interaction loop going, use at least one class, and must have multiple methods that are called.

 Make at least 1 package: ui
 Make at least one class named appropriately for your application
 Make a main method that gets things going
 Construct an object (Note: this should probably happen within your main method)
 Declare a field and use it (not necessarily at the same time!)
 Pass a parameter
 Use a local variable
 Return a value and use it
 Use a condition, and a loop
 Make a call graph from your main method
 Draw the flowchart for a method with a condition or a loop
 Get user input, and reflect it back to the user
 Use the debugger
